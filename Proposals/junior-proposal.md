**Is your project Solo or Team? Team**


## Description

**Currently in the work with this particular project as previously stated. I hope to bring this project into a further stage, but don't intend to have this intensive be the end of the work I do on it either. During these next two weeks though, I hope to use skills learned from the past term to create a better UI that will allow for ease of use and is just more aesthetically pleasing. I hope to do this by setting a goal to reach every three to two days out of each major part to work on. My main focus plans to be working on turning the marketplace into a collection view with recently added items and the different item categories. The Second biggest item would be to add a shopping cart which people can add to, that would allow people start getting the items they want, and have a single place where they can view this information. I will need to keep in contact with my team to make sure my work does not interfere with theirs, and that were on the same page for how things will need to be done.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
- Working from home with potential distractions
- Finding the time to get help, and making sure I can get accurate help

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**
- Refactoring market place
- Add cart: Add and delete items from here
- (if time) Setting up a proper tab bar controller (current one works, so I am more focused on getting the other items of the project to work)
**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 
- Profile can look at current and previous orders

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 
- Incorporating chat feature into the
